Instructions:

Install Python if you don't have it yet.
configuration.bat: Make your own list of tasks.
TaskRandomizer.bat: Get a random task out of a weighted list.

I've included an example tasklist. Feel free to change it using configuration.bat, or if you want to clear it completely and start over, you can delete the file tasks.json in the directory etc.
